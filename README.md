Database Microbialite

This project was made for my database class. It is a full stack CRUD applications made to record Microbialite research data. For the project we were given an Access database made by the professor conducting the research and we normalized the data into new relations and migrated some of it into our database. We recreated the reports from the original database in SQL. The advantage of using SQL over Microsft Access is that SQL scales better and can be linked to larger applications.

Domain-Viewpoint: One of the client's reason for upgrading his database system was to facilitate research amongst a larger team of student researchers and collaboration with other researchers. This isn't possible with Microsoft Access because each is its own seperate instance. This means that if a researcher updates their own file it won't propogate to other files. We decided to make a web application because it seemed like the easiest way to facilitate information sharing. Research added to the database can be viewed or updated by anyone with the correct credentials.
